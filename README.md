# Gutenberg 2 IPFS

This repository is for looking into how we can get all of [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page) onto [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/).

First we need to
1. Get all the data
2. Put it onto the IPFS network
3. Keep the data on there
4. Make a front-end website for accessing it.
